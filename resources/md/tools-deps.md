# deps.edn support — design notes

How Jolt loads pure-Clojure libraries from a `deps.edn`, and why it's built the
way it is. For how to *use* it, see [building-and-deps.md](/docs/building-and-deps.html).

Scope, decided up front:

- **source resolution only** — git, local, and Maven coordinates all resolve to
  Clojure *source* directories; compiled `.class` files are ignored.
- **pure `clj`/`cljc`** — anything needing the JVM won't load or run; expected.
- **no classpath abstraction** — `require` just needs to find a dep's namespaces;
  "the classpath" is an ordered list of source directories.
- **own resolver, own reader** — `deps.edn` is read by jolt's own reader, and
  fetching is a thin shell-out to `git`/`curl`/`unzip`; no external package
  manager.
- **deps-agnostic runtime core** — resolution is a CLI front-end concern, not a
  runtime one. The runtime knows nothing about `deps.edn`; it only consumes a
  list of source roots. The CLI resolves a `deps.edn` into those roots before
  running.

## How resolution works

`jolt.deps` (`jolt-core/jolt/deps.clj`) reads `deps.edn` (jolt's own reader
parses the EDN), then walks `:deps`:

- `:git/url` + `:git/sha` (+ optional `:deps/root`) → clone the sha into the git
  cache and contribute the checkout (or its `:deps/root` subdir);
- `:local/root` → the path as-is;
- `:mvn/version` → fetch the JAR and use its extracted Clojure source as a
  root (see below);
- anything else → ignored.

git resolution shells out to `git` through `jolt.host/sh` — `git init` + remote
add + fetch + reset at the requested sha. An existing `tools.gitlibs` checkout
(`$GITLIBS`, else `~/.gitlibs`) is reused when the JVM toolchain already
fetched the sha; otherwise clones land in a global, sha-immutable cache
(`$JOLT_GITLIBS`, else `~/.jolt/gitlibs`) shared across projects.

Maven resolution works because a Clojure library's JAR ships its `.clj`/`.cljc`
source, not just bytecode: the JAR is fetched (Clojars, then Maven Central)
into the standard local repository (`~/.m2/repository`) at its standard path —
so artifacts are shared with JVM Clojure/tools.deps in both directions — and
extracted once into a `<artifact>-<version>.jar.jolt/` directory beside it,
whose source becomes the root. The POM's `<dependency>` blocks supply
transitive deps (test/provided/optional scopes skipped). A JAR with no
Clojure source (pure Java) contributes nothing; the ClojureScript compiler
subtree is skipped outright. `:mvn/local-repo` in `deps.edn` relocates the
repository like tools.deps; `JOLT_LOCAL_REPO` overrides from the environment.

Each resolved dependency contributes its own `:paths` (default `["src"]`) as
source roots; the walk is **breadth-first** so every top-level coordinate
registers before any transitive one — a top-level pin always wins, matching
tools.deps. The result is a de-duplicated, ordered list of directories.

Two tools.deps features are mirrored in reduced form. **Aliases**: `:aliases`
entries supply `:extra-paths`/`:extra-deps` (accumulate across the aliases
selected with `-A:a:b`) and `:main-opts` (last-wins, run with `-M:alias`).
**Tasks**: the honest subset of babashka's — a string task is a shell command, a
map task is `{:main-opts […]}`; bare Clojure expressions aren't a separate task
form.

## How the CLI ties it together

`jolt.main` (`jolt-core/jolt/main.clj`) is the CLI dispatch. Driven by `cli.ss`,
it resolves the project (`jolt.deps/resolve-project`), prepends the resolved
roots, and de-sugars the argv into a run:

- `run -m NS args` → load `NS`, call its `-main`;
- `run FILE` → load the file;
- `-M:alias` → run the alias's `:main-opts`;
- `-A:alias` → add the alias's paths/deps, then run the rest;
- `repl` → a line REPL;
- `path` → print the resolved roots;
- `build -m NS [-o OUT] [--opt|--dev]` → AOT-compile the app into a standalone binary;
- `<task>` → run a `deps.edn` `:tasks` entry.

The resolver lives in the overlay alongside the runtime, but the runtime's only
dependency interface is the list of source roots it's handed.

Scripts can also resolve deps at runtime with `jolt.deps/add-deps` (the
`babashka.deps/add-deps` twin) — same coordinates, roots appended after the
current ones so an added dep never shadows a loaded namespace. See
[Dependencies (jolt.deps)](/docs/api/deps.html).

## Native libraries

A library that binds C declares the shared objects it needs under `:jolt/native`,
so `jolt.main` loads them before the namespace is required and its `foreign-fn`
bindings resolve. Each entry is a map — `{:name "sqlite3" :darwin
["libsqlite3.0.dylib" …] :linux ["libsqlite3.so.0" …]}` — with optional
`:optional true` (absence is fine, a feature-gated dep) and `:process true` (use
the running process's own symbols, e.g. libc sockets, no external file). A
project inherits its dependencies' `:jolt/native`.

### Static vs dynamic linking

When you `joltc build`, a native lib is **statically linked** into the binary by
default if the spec carries a `:static` archive — so the executable calls the C
code with no shared object present at runtime. Add `:static` alongside the runtime
candidates:

```clojure
{:name "sqlite3"
 :static {:archive "/opt/homebrew/lib/libsqlite3.a"}  ; or {:lib "sqlite3" :libdir "/usr/lib"}
 :darwin ["libsqlite3.0.dylib"]   ; still used by `run`/`repl` and by --dynamic
 :linux  ["libsqlite3.so.0"]}
```

`:static {:archive PATH}` force-loads the whole `.a` and is the reliable
cross-platform form. `:static {:lib NAME :libdir DIR}` links `-lNAME` (with a
`-Bstatic` preference on Linux); on macOS, which has no `-Bstatic`, prefer the
archive form. A spec with no `:static` (or a build passed `--dynamic`, or
`:jolt/build {:dynamic-natives true}`) loads the shared object dynamically at
startup via `load-shared-object`.

Static linking needs a C compiler (`cc`) on `PATH` at build time (plus the C libs
the Chez kernel links — lz4, zlib, ncurses). The distributed `joltc` bundles the
Chez kernel, so it re-links the launcher stub with the archive baked in — no
external Chez, just `cc`. Without a `cc`, a `:static` lib fails with a message
pointing you to install one or pass `--dynamic`. Keep a `:darwin`/`:linux`
candidate on any `:static` spec so `run`/`repl` (which have no static binary) can
still load it.

## Standalone binaries

`joltc build -m NS` compiles the app and every library into one executable (the
runtime + compiler are baked in). Resolved `:jolt/native` libs are statically
linked in (or loaded at startup — see [Native libraries](#native-libraries)), so
an FFI app — sockets, SQLite — runs with no jolt or Chez on the path.

Output goes under the project's `target/`, cargo-style: `target/release/<project>`
by default and with `--opt`, `target/debug/<project>` with `--dev` (the
`<name>.build` scratch dir sits beside it). `-o PATH` overrides — absolute as-is,
relative against the project dir. Paths resolve against the project (`JOLT_PWD`),
not the CLI's cwd, since `bin/joltc` runs from the jolt repo.

`:jolt/build {:embed ["resources" …]}` bakes those directories' files into the
binary; `io/resource` serves them from the image with no files on disk. Resources
not embedded resolve at runtime against `JOLT_PWD` (or the cwd), so the
ship-the-binary-with-its-`resources/`-dir model also works. Files read through
`io/file` (e.g. a `config.edn` a config library loads) stay external by design —
edit them without rebuilding.

A standalone build needs Chez's kernel dev files (`libkernel.a`, `scheme.h`) and
a C compiler; `JOLT_CHEZ_CSV` overrides the auto-detected `csv<ver>/<machine>`
dir. `--opt` turns on the inference/flatten/scalar-replace passes; the default
`release` mode is const-fold only.

`--direct-link` (or `:jolt/build {:direct-link true}`) opts into a closed world: a
call between the app's own functions binds to its target directly, skipping the var
lookup and generic dispatch a runtime call pays — at the cost of runtime
redefinition of those vars and `eval`/`load-string`. It's off by default, so
ordinary builds (including `release` and `--opt`) stay dynamically linked. A var
marked `^:redef` or `^:dynamic` stays indirect even under `--direct-link`, and calls
into `clojure.core` stay indirect in every mode.

## Tree-shaking

`--tree-shake` (or `:jolt/build {:tree-shake true}`) ships only the code reachable
from `-main`. The build constructs one call graph spanning the app, every resolved
library, and the `clojure.core`/stdlib prelude, then keeps `-main`, every
side-effecting top-level form (so a `defmethod`/`defrecord`/protocol registration
keeps its targets live), and everything reachable from those — dropping the rest. A
reference counts whether it's a call or a value (`#'x`, a fn passed to `map`, a fn
stored in a map): any reference keeps its target live, so nothing reachable is ever
dropped. An app that never compiles at runtime (no reachable `eval`/`load-string`)
also drops the analyzer and back end from the binary. Typical savings are 1–2 MB;
behaviour is unchanged.

**It bails — keeps everything — when reachable code resolves a var by name at
runtime** (`eval`, `resolve`, `ns-resolve`, `requiring-resolve`, `find-var`,
`intern`, `load-string`, `load-file`). A static call graph can't follow a runtime
`resolve`, so dropping anything would be unsound. The build prints which definitions
forced the bail:

```
jolt build: tree-shake skipped (reachable code resolves vars at runtime):
  selmer.filters/generate-json -> clojure.core/resolve
  clojure.tools.logging/call-str -> clojure.core/ns-resolve
```

These are almost always libraries, not your code — `resolve` is how mature Clojure
libraries implement plugin systems and optional integrations (a logging backend
chosen at runtime, a template filter that lazily loads an optional dependency). On
the JVM that costs nothing; in a closed-world binary it defeats reachability. To make
an app tree-shakeable, keep runtime resolution off the *reachable* path: a backend
that's fixed on jolt can be referenced directly rather than resolved (the jolt
`tools.logging` port dropped the JVM's dynamic factory selection for exactly this),
and an optional integration you don't use can be dropped or hard-wired. Unreached
`resolve`-using code is shaken away like anything else — only resolution on the live
path triggers the bail.

The closed-world soundness model follows Stalin's dead-code analysis: in a program
with no `eval`, a definition is live iff it is referenced (called or as a value) from
a root, transitively.

## Limitations

- Pure `clj`/`cljc` only — JVM interop, host classes, and unimplemented
  `clojure.core` corners fail. Coverage is per-function: a namespace can load with
  most functions working and a few not.
- Source only; compiled `.class` files in a git dep are ignored.
- git `:git/sha` must be a full SHA (`git fetch` can't resolve a short one).

## Stack traces

An uncaught error prints the message, the top-level source location, and — when
frames are available — a `trace:` backtrace. In an AOT `jolt build --direct-link`
binary the frames map to `ns/name (file:line)`; on the runtime eval path they are
the surviving fn names. Tail-call optimization erases tail-called frames, so the
default trace shows only the non-tail spine.

A fuller **tail-frame history** recovers the frames TCO erases: each compiled fn
records itself on entry into a bounded ring-of-rings buffer, so the trace shows
TCO-elided frames (including the immediate error site) while a tight tail loop
stays bounded and its non-tail caller context is preserved.

It is **on by default in REPL-driven development** — a `repl` or nREPL session
turns it on, so an error in code you evaluate or reload shows a tail-frame trace
with no setup. Because the recording is baked in at compile time, only code
compiled while a session is live is traced; reload a namespace to trace code that
was already loaded (e.g. an app's initial `-M:run` load before its nREPL started).

Elsewhere it is off (a small per-call cost, and never emitted into a `jolt build`
binary). Override with the environment: `JOLT_TRACE=1` forces it on for a whole
run — including a plain `-M:run`, so the app's own load is traced — and
`JOLT_TRACE=0` forces it off, even in a REPL/nREPL session.

## Conformance

The known-working libraries (see [libraries.md](/docs/libraries.html)) and the
[examples](https://github.com/jolt-lang/examples) exercise real pure-`cljc` git
libraries end to end — resolving them from git, loading their namespaces, and
running sample calls. A library fails when it relies on something Jolt doesn't
provide — JVM interop, or a regex feature like Unicode property classes
(`\p{…}`).
